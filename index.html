            <div id="p01show" class='textDiv'>It was snowing outside; my plane had been <span class='delay' id='delay01'>delayed</span> for <span id='delayAnHour'>an hour</span>. <span class='nyTime' id='theCity01'>The city</span> did not want me to leave, and I didn't want to leave either<br/><br/></div>

            <div id='p02' class='hiddenText'>The captain told us that he was going to walk around the cabin to greet everyone because he had plenty of time to do so. I was amused, I had plenty of time to <span class='write02'>write</span><br/><br/></div>

            <div id='p03' class='hiddenText'>God knows how many novels I have started on the plane. Maybe this was going to be another unfinished inflight project<span class='next03'>[next]</span><br/><br/></div>

            <div id="p04" class='hiddenText'>I started reading the book by Chelsea Hudson that Max gave me. He said <i>you need to <span class='read04'>read</span> this</i><br/><br/></div>

            <div id="p05" class='hiddenText'>I remembered the conversation that we had last night about <span class='journal05'>writers don't journal</span>. Funny that Chelsea wrote about it too in the first paragraph of her book<br/><br/></div>

            <div id="p06" class='hiddenText'>I had so much that I wanted to write down. In fact, I needed to write them down so badly that I started writing before what I wrote about even happened<br/><br/></div>

            <div id='p07' class='hiddenText'>they are spraying green goo on the wings of the plane, before they started spraying green goo on the wings of the plane. <span class='seenIt07'>I’ve seen it before</span>, in <span class='chiTime chicago07'>Chicago</span><br/><br/></div>


            <div id='p08' class='hiddenText'>One of the things that I wrote about on the plane was how time seems to be suspended on the plane. The fact that you would be strapped on a tiny seat with nowhere else to go, nothing to do. But my mind was traveling through time, just like my body, you gain <span class='gainHour gainHour08'>an hour</span>, lose <span class='loseHour loseHour08'>an hour</span><br/><br/></div>


            <div id='p09' class='hiddenText'>We were still <span class='waiting09'>waiting</span> in line to get deiced, it might take an hour. The captain said something about lying through the <button class='intercom09'>intercom</button><br/><br/></div>

            <div id='p10' class='hiddenText'>I was reading about the red planet, thinking about the icy water on Mars, and the icy water on the wings of the plane. I looked up and the captain started to walk down the aisle, shaking everyone’s hands<br/><br/></div>

            <div id='p25' class='hiddenText'>Sitting in the plane, I’ve always felt this way, peak-plateau experience. And when I travel, I always came home fallen in love, fallen out of love<br/><br/></div>
