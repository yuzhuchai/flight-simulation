        <div id='text'>
            <div id="p01show" class='textDiv'>It was snowing outside; my plane had been <span class='delay' id='delay01'>delayed</span> for <span id='delayAnHour'>an hour</span>. <span class='nyTime' id='theCity01'>The city</span> did not want me to leave, and I didn't want to leave either.<br/><br/></div>

            <div id='p02' class='hiddenText textDiv'>The captain told us that he was going to walk around the cabin to greet everyone because he had plenty of time to do so. I was amused, I had plenty of time to <span class='write02'>write</span>.<br/><br/></div>

            <div id='p03' class='hiddenText textDiv'>God knows how many novels I have started on the plane. Maybe this was going to be another unfinished inflight project.<span class='next03'>[next]</span><br/><br/></div>

            <div id="p04" class='hiddenText textDiv'>I started reading the book by Chelsea Hudson that Max gave me. He said <i>you need to <span class='read04'>read</span> this.</i><br/><br/></div>

            <div id="p05" class='hiddenText textDiv'>I remembered the conversation that we had last night about <span class='journal05'>writers don't journal</span>. Funny that Chelsea wrote about it too in the first paragraph of her book. <br/><br/></div>

            <div id="p06" class='hiddenText textDiv'>I had so much that I wanted to write down. In fact, I needed to write them down so badly that I started writing before what I wrote about even happened. <br/><br/></div>

            <div id='p07' class='hiddenText textDiv'>they are spraying green goo on the wings of the plane, before they started spraying green goo on the wings of the plane. <span class='seenIt07'>Iâ€™ve seen it before</span>, in <span class='chiTime chicago07'>Chicago</span>.<br/><br/></div>


            <div id='p08' class='hiddenText textDiv'>One of the things that I wrote about on the plane was how time seems to be suspended on the plane. The fact that you would be strapped on a tiny seat with nowhere else to go, nothing to do. But my mind was traveling through time, just like my body, you gain an hour, lose an hour.<br/><br/></div>


            <div id='p09' class='hiddenText textDiv'>We were still waiting in line to get deiced, it might take an hour. The captain said something about lying through the intercom.<br/><br/></div>
